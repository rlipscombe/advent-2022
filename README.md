# Advent of Code, 2022

This year, I originally planned to do the challenges in
[Gleam](https://gleam.run), but I seem to be back on my "at least one different
language every day" thing. On average, anyway.

I usually start with [Elixir Livebook](https://livebook.dev) because it's a
good way to explore the problem.

- Day 1: [Elixir Livebook](livebook/day01.livemd), [Gleam](gleam/day01/), [awk](awk/day01.awk), [Rust](rust/day01/), [jq](jq/)
- Day 2: [Elixir Livebook](livebook/day02.livemd), [awk](awk/day02.awk), [Gleam](gleam/day02/)
- Day 3: [Elixir Livebook](livebook/day03.livemd), [bash](bash/day03/)
- Day 4: [Elixir Livebook](livebook/day04.livemd), [Gleam](gleam/day04/), [F#](fsharp/day04/)
- Day 5: [Elixir Livebook](livebook/day05.livemd), [Python](python/day05.py)
- Day 6: [Erlang](erlang/day06.escript), [Elixir Livebook](livebook/day06.livemd), [Rust](rust/day06/), [C](c/day06/), [jq](jq/)
- Day 7: [Elixir Livebook](livebook/day07.livemd)
- Day 8: [Elixir Livebook](livebook/day08.livemd), [Dart](dart/day08/)

So far: 8 days, 11 languages.

## Language Ideas

- Perl, Ruby, Haskell, C#, C++, Racket, Kotlin, Squirrel, Lua, Powershell, Go, Crystal, OCaml, Zig, Javascript, Typescript, Num, Scala.

## Previous years

- [2021](https://github.com/rlipscombe/advent-2021), I started trying a different language each day, but ended up just using Elixir Livebook.
- [2020](https://github.com/rlipscombe/advent-2020), Rust and Elixir, some awk.
- [2019](https://github.com/rlipscombe/advent-2019), Rust and Elixir.
- [2015](https://github.com/rlipscombe/advent-2015); I did this in December 2021, while ill with COVID. Elixir Livebook.
- [2015 (Dart)](https://github.com/rlipscombe/advent-2015-dart); I did this in March 2022, to learn some Dart.
