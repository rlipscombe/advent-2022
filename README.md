# Advent of Code, 2022

This year, I originally planned to do the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022) challenges
in [Gleam](https://gleam.run), but I seem to be back on my "at least one different language every day"
thing.

On average, anyway.

I usually start with [Elixir Livebook](https://livebook.dev) because it's a
good way to explore the problem.

## Previous years

- [2021](https://github.com/rlipscombe/advent-2021), I started trying a different language each day, but ended up just using Elixir Livebook.
- [2020](https://github.com/rlipscombe/advent-2020), Rust and Elixir, some awk.
- [2019](https://github.com/rlipscombe/advent-2019), Rust and Elixir.
- [2015](https://github.com/rlipscombe/advent-2015); I did this in December 2021, while ill with COVID. Elixir Livebook.
- [2015 (Dart)](https://github.com/rlipscombe/advent-2015-dart); I did this in March 2022, to learn some Dart.
